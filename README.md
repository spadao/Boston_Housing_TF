# Boston_Housing_TF

 Using TensorFlow to model a regression on the famous Boston Housing Dataset

---

 In this project, along with the modelling two EDA tools will be tested:

1. `SweetViz` -> Tool to automate and simplify EDA process, especially useful to determine the relationships between the target and the other features, as well as validate that the train/test split is similarly distributed and don't have biases created by the split.
2. `D-Tale` -> More in-depth customization EDA tool that helps to deeply analyse the behaviour of the data on the dataset
